# Bitirme-Projesi

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project, an application will allow users to control mouse cursor and keyboard inputs on the computer by detecting the hand movements of the user. 

#### Application is divided into three parts.

- Controlling the mouse cursor on the computer as a result of moving the hand by showing it to the camera
- Drawing on the screen by controlling the cursor with the hand movement
- Writing with hand alphabet signs. 

These sections will be briefly referred to as mouse control, drawing and typing functions. Thanks to these functions to be accessed from the application's interface, it will be possible to control the computer using only one hand.
